## Which course will be good to learn Docker?

I thought Docker was some fancy stuff and not sure how to use it before. I made up my mind to pick up Docker because I failed all the questions related to Docker in my recent interview and feel sucks. About one year ago I started to learn Docker and I quitted because I lost interest on the second day when reading that handbook.

I realized that it would be important for us to choose the right course to learn because we will lose our interest quickly if they are not good enough. I am still learning Docker by watching different online courses. I haven't finished all the course materials and realized that I should learn Docker early. It gives me so much freedom to try things quickly.

### Docker Course
- Docker Mastery: with Kubernetes + Swarm from a Docker Captain by Bret Fisher
- Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide by Stephen Grider

###  Docker Handbook
- [The Docker Handbook - 2021 Edition](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-docker-handbook/#hello-world-in-docker-intro-to-docker-basics)

I think Stephen's course has its own advantages. For example, he explained what is docker and what happened when we run docker very well. However, the course is a bit outdated. The commands used in this course are old versions and he didn't introduce the new versions.

Bret Fisher talked more about docker commands and he also explained the differences between the old version and the new version of the commands. We can practice through assignments and think independently. However, he didn't explain concepts in detail when compared with Stephen's course. I think it would be good if we learn from them both. By the way, I think we can still use Docker Handbook as a reference and keep it handy but do not use it as the main source. 

Please leave your comments below if you recommend some other courses or materials.
