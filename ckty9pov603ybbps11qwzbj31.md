## Useful Visual Studio Extensions for Every Developer


If you are a graduate or developer you will find these extensions really useful and essential. I hope I knew these tools when I study at uni. These Visual Studio Code extensions are categorized for general purpose, I hope you can enjoy finding some of them useful to help you code more efficiently.

## Autocompleter

“TabNine” and “Visual Studio IntelliCode” provide AI-assisted autocomplete to help you write code faster. TabNine supports all language, for example, C# while Visual Studio IntelliCode only supports Python, TypeScript/JavaScript and Java. You can install both of them.

## Efficiency

Install **“Terminal” by Jun Hun**, it will save a lot of time by running the terminal from the text editor. **“stack-tabs” **can keep the most recent files to the left. Definitely install “Bracket Pair Colorizer 2”, it is s customizable extension for colonizing matching brackets. It helps me in reducing time to find brackets I accidentally deleted.

## **Formatter**

**“Prettier code formatter”** and **“Beautify” a**re quite popular. I personally prefer to user**“Prettier code formatter” **since it supports more languages. Try **“EditorConfig for VS code”** if you have more strict requirements for formatting.

## Icons Theme

“**Material Icon Them**” and **“vscode-icons” **can provide beautiful icons for files and folders using icons. I personally prefer to use “**Material Icon Them**” since I think it looks better.

## Highlight for Comments

**“TODO Highlight”** and **“Better Comments” **remind you to finish some TODO functions by highlighting your comments. I prefer to use **“TODO Highlight”** because it attracts more attention from me and easier to start.

## **Git**

“Git History”, “GitLens — Git supercharged”, “gitlink”, .gitignore Generator”, GitHub Pull Requests and Issues” are really popular in the market. If you haven’t install any extensions for git yet, definitely give them a try.

## Other Extensions

There are some other extensions recommended by other developers as well. I do not really use them at the moment so I will just list them here.

These are: better align, bookmarks, peacock, polacode, project manager, remote -ssh, setting sync, guides.

That’s it! Let me know if you think there are other useful extensions in the market which I missed in this article by leaving your comment below.
